# Knights-of-Camelot
2D tile based RPG game.
Currently a side project to keep up on coding as I continue to study for my CS degree. No current plans to release this. 
The ground work was laid by following a youtube series that introduced a number of basic game development classes and APIs, but unfortunately stopped far short of a functional game (I think the person moved on to a different project). This provided a great challenge to go out and learn everything I could and try to implement it myself.
